# Ex.No.6 AI-Assisted Programming and Debugging
# Aim:
Write and implement Python code that integrates with multiple AI tools to automate the task of interacting with APIs, comparing outputs, and generating actionable insights with Multiple AI Tools

# AI Tools Required:
 ChatGPT
 Google Gemini
 Claude
 Python
 Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
 VS Code
 
 # 📌 Application Selected
 ## Intelligent User Behaviour Anomaly Detector
 The selected application is an Intelligent User Behaviour Anomaly Detection System.

The system analyzes employee behavioural data such as:

Login time
Login location
File access frequency
USB usage
Email activity
Device information
The system uses these features to identify unusual or suspicious employee behaviour.

For anomaly detection, the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm is used.

# 👨‍💻 Persona Pattern
## Persona
Act as an experienced Python programmer and machine learning engineer specializing in cybersecurity and anomaly detection.

Write clean, efficient, readable, modular, and maintainable Python code.

The code should include proper preprocessing, error handling, anomaly detection, complexity analysis, and unit testing.

## 1️⃣ Python Code Generation Using AI
Prompt Given to AI Tools
"Act as an experienced Python programmer. Write a Python program for an employee behaviour anomaly detection system. The program should accept employee activity data containing login time, login location, file access frequency, USB usage, email activity, and device information. Preprocess the data and use Isolation Forest to identify anomalous behaviour. Display the detected anomalies clearly."

## 🤖 ChatGPT Output
ChatGPT generated a simple implementation using Pandas, LabelEncoder, and Isolation Forest.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("employee_activity.csv")

# Encode categorical columns
encoder = LabelEncoder()

data["login_location"] = encoder.fit_transform(
    data["login_location"]
)

data["device_used"] = encoder.fit_transform(
    data["device_used"]
)

# Select features
features = [
    "login_time",
    "login_location",
    "file_access_frequency",
    "usb_usage",
    "email_activity",
    "device_used"
]

X = data[features]

# Train Isolation Forest
model = IsolationForest(
    contamination=0.1,
    random_state=42
)

data["anomaly"] = model.fit_predict(X)

# Convert prediction into readable labels
data["status"] = data["anomaly"].map({
    1: "Normal",
    -1: "Anomalous"
})

print(data[["status"]])
Observation
The ChatGPT solution was simple and beginner-friendly. It directly loads the dataset, encodes categorical features, applies Isolation Forest, and displays the prediction.

## 2️⃣ Google Gemini Output

🧮 Complexity Analysis
## Prompt
"Explain the time and space complexity of the employee behaviour anomaly detection code."

Let:

n = number of employee records
m = number of features
t = number of trees in the Isolation Forest
Time Complexity
Data Preprocessing
Each record and feature may need to be processed.

Time Complexity:

O(n × m)
Isolation Forest
The practical training cost depends on the number of records and trees.

Approximately:

O(t × n log n)
where:

t = number of trees
n = number of records
Overall
The major computational cost comes from preprocessing and model training.

O(n × m + t × n log n)
Space Complexity
The dataset requires approximately:

O(n × m)
memory.

Additional memory is required for the Isolation Forest decision trees.

Therefore, the overall memory requirement depends on both the dataset and the number of trees.

## 💡 Analysis and Discussion
AI-assisted programming significantly reduced the time required to generate the initial Python implementation.

ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude were able to generate different implementations of an employee behaviour anomaly detection system using the Isolation Forest algorithm.

ChatGPT provided a simple and beginner-friendly implementation.

Gemini provided a more structured implementation using reusable functions.

Claude provided a modular implementation with better error handling.

The comparison showed that different AI tools can produce different approaches for the same programming problem.

However, AI-generated code cannot be accepted without verification. AI-generated programs may contain missing validation, incorrect assumptions, runtime errors, unsuitable preprocessing, or inefficient implementations.

Therefore, the programmer must review, test, debug, and validate the generated code before using it.

The experiment demonstrates that AI tools can assist in:

Code generation
Debugging
Code optimization
Complexity analysis
Unit-test generation
Code explanation
Human programming knowledge is still necessary to verify the correctness and reliability of the final solution.

## 🏆 Best AI-Assisted Approach
The most reliable approach is not to depend on a single AI tool.

The best approach is to combine:

AI-generated code + comparison + human verification + debugging + optimization + testing.

## ✅ Conclusion
This experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of AI-assisted programming and debugging using multiple AI tools.

ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claude were used to generate Python code for an intelligent employee behaviour anomaly detection application.

The generated programs were compared based on readability, modularity, efficiency, error handling, maintainability, and testing support.

AI tools significantly reduced development time and provided useful assistance in code generation, debugging, optimization, complexity analysis, and unit-test generation.

However, AI-generated code may contain logical errors, incorrect assumptions, runtime errors, or security issues.

Therefore, human review, testing, debugging, and engineering validation are essential before using AI-generated code in real-world applications.

## Final Finding
AI-assisted programming is most effective when AI-generated code is combined with human expertise, testing, debugging, optimization, and validation rather than being used without verification.

## 🎯 Result
The corresponding prompt was executed successfully.

The employee behaviour anomaly detection application was generated using multiple AI tools, compared, debugged, optimized, tested, and analyzed successfully.

Thus, the experiment on AI-Assisted Programming and Debugging was completed successfully.
